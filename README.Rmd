This website is the home, a personal package, and a vehicle for graphs made with R. It is the home because the site summarizes all kind of visualizations that I made for my work. However, it is also an R package and it installs the source code of many illustrations and the package provides functions to make graphs with `ggplot2` (e.g., slope plots)

## Installation

You can install Graphs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/edgar")
```

## Illustrations

The package installs the source code for all illustrations from this website. The `plotgraph()` function just picks the installed source code and returns the graphs. For example, the `datasaurus` plot.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## basic example code
library(edgar)
plotgraph("datasaurus.R")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Data saurus by Edgar Treischl'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/web_only/illustrations/saurus.png")
```


Inspect the website to for a specific graph. Without input, the `plotgraph()` function returns all available graphs.

```{r example, warning=TRUE, error=TRUE}
plotgraph()
```


## Graphs

And the package gives access to shortcut functions to make `ggplot2` graphs. For example, `ggslope()` returns a slope chart.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
df <- tribble(
 ~times, ~country,  ~gdp, ~inc,
 "1990",   "A",  22.3, TRUE,
 "2000",   "A",  44.6, TRUE,
 "1990",   "B",  12.3, FALSE,
 "2000",   "B",  4.6, FALSE
 )

ggslope(df,
         times = times,
         outcome = gdp,
         group = country)+
  theme_minimal()
```
