This is a personal R package and a home for stuff made with R. It installs the source code of illustrations, apps, and functions (e.g., slope plots with `ggplot2`).

## Installation

You can install the package from my [GitHub](https://github.com/) account:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/edgar")
```
