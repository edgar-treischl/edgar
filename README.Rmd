This is a personal R package for different stuff made with R. It installs the source code of illustrations, apps, and functions that I wanted to recycle (e.g., slope plots with `ggplot2`). Feel free to reuse the code for your own projects, but of course, you can install this package as well.

## Installation

You can install the package from my [GitHub](https://github.com/) account:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/edgar")
```

The rest of this page provides an example of the package's content. You can find more examples under articles.

## Shiny Apps

I created several shiny apps for different purposes. For example, the `power` app illustrates what statistical power is and how it depends on the sample size, effect size, and significance level by letting the user adjust those parameters on the fly.

## Illustrations

Every now and then I searched in my own code for a specific graph that I wanted to reuse. The package includes some of the graphs that I created which might be a good starting point for my future self or for your own project. The `plotgraph()` function runs the installed source code and returns the graphs. For example, do you know the `datasaurus` plot?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# plotgraph function runs the source code
library(edgar)
plot_graph("datasaurus.R")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt='Data saurus by Edgar Treischl'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/saurus.png")
```

Without input, the `plotgraph()` function returns available graphs.

```{r example, warning=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# list available graphs without input
plot_graph()
```

## Graphs

And the package gives access to helper functions to make or improve `ggplot2` graphs. For example, `ggslope()` returns a slope plot and you may reuse it if you provide the necessary data. The function is a wrapper for `geom_segment()` and `geom_text()` and is useful to compare the change of a variable over time or between groups. The following code shows how to use the function.

```{r, fig.retina=2}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

#example data
df <- tribble(
 ~times, ~country,  ~gdp, ~inc,
 "1990",   "A",  22.3, TRUE,
 "2000",   "A",  44.6, TRUE,
 "1990",   "B",  12.3, FALSE,
 "2000",   "B",  4.6, FALSE
 )

#slope plot
ggslope(df, 
        times = times,
        outcome = gdp,
        group = country)+
  theme_minimal()
```
