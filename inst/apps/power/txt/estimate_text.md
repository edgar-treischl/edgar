### How many observations do we need?

Below you can see the output of a power analysis that calculates the number of observation needed to have sufficient statistical power to find an effect; and on the left side I made a visualization that illustrate only how many observations per group (control and treatment group) we would need to have a sufficient power. Feel free to adjust the effect size and the power and see how the needed sample size increases (or decreases) based on the estimation of the power analysis!

However, this apps highlights the main idea of a power analysis, but in order to estimate the number of observation that are needed to detect an effect, we have to specify additionally the significance level (e.g. 95% significance level) and - in case of a t-test with a treatment and control group - decide which kind of hypothesis testing we apply. For instance, we can assume that the expected mean difference is "greater", "less", or "two.sided" if both is possible. If you provide an estimate for the effect size, statistical power, the significance level, a value for the hypothesis test, you can run a power analysis to determine number of observations.
