### Maximize the number of observations?

Ultimately, there is only one question left from the start. Is ti wise to increase the sample at any cost? Look at the plot on the left side. This time you can see three different power analysis for small effect sizes and you can increase the number of observation to check how many observations are needed to get a sufficient power.

All three groups do not have sufficient power (\>0.8) in case of small sample size. However, look what happens if you increase the sample size. You may detect a significant effect even in case of a very small effect size! Thus, keep in mind that a large sample size increases the statistical power, which implies that even a very small differences could become significant, even though such a small effect may not make any difference from a substantial point of view.

Next time you encounter a study with a very large sample size, please ask yourself whether a significant effect is also substantial (e.g. in terms of explained variance, substantial mean differences) not just whether the reported differences are significant or not. Obviously, a large sample size is not everything.
