#### The independent variables:

The survival of the Titanic is a binary outcome and on the left side you can see how many people survived, based on a series of simple bar plot. However, If we want to explore the effect of several independent variables simultaneously, we can use a Sankey plot. A Sankey plot shows you how these variable work together. You can literally see how many people of each of group survived (1) or did not survive (0).

What would you say? Which one has the strongest effect on the survival? It looks like sex and class have a strong effect on survival. Instead of guessing, we can use a logistic regression to estimate the effect of passengers' sex, age, and class simultaneously. You never applied a linear regression? Well, check out the [regression in a nutshell app](http://rstudio.edgar-treischl.de/shiny/ols/) first because this app assumes that you are familiar with the principals of a linear regression analysis.
