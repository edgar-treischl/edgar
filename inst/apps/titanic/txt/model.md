#### The Model:

Let's run a logistic regression. Which of the following independent variables do you want to include to estimate the effect on survival? <br/>

Maybe you picked passenger's sex, but what tells you the estimate(s) of your model? The estimate for Male compared to women is negative and -2.51? Due to the assumptions of the logistic regression, we get the logarithm of the odds to survive as a results. In case of log(odds), we can only say whether an effect is positiv or negative and check the significane. Thus, such a estimate is hard to explain what it really means. Instead of the log odds, we can estimate odds ratios and make prediction about the probability to survive. Both are easier to interpret.
