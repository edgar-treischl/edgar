### Shoe Size explain income?

As outlined, shoe size and peoples' income can be correlated. The biological sex of a person determines feet size and men have on average a higher income (e.g. due to part time work) compared to women. Thus, the third variable *sex* is a common cause that affect both variables, shoe size and income. 

The scatter plot on the right side illustrates this example. Depending on how strong sex is related with income and shoe size, we may observe a substantial effect of shoe size on income. However, see what happens if we control for sex. In terms of a scatter plot, we split the data we give each sex a different color; or in terms of a multivariate analysis, we include sex in the analysis.
