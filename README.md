# edgar

This is a personal R package and a home for apps and graphs made with R.
The site shows several visualizations that I made for my work. However,
it is also an R package and it installs the source code of many
illustrations, apps, and functions to make graphs with `ggplot2` (e.g.,
slope plots). Hallo Welt.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/edgar")
```
